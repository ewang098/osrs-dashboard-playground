## Code Maintainability
- add linting checks and update repo so PRs are required to merge
- refactor deployable code to own folder and update repo deploy folder
- add unit tests

## New Pages
- add kenshi page with first being longest reach for each weapon type (make sure data itself is in javascript for easy maintenance)
- add battle brothers page (quick ref on accuracy bonuses - i.e. spear, sword, polearm)
